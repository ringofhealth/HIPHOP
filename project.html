                    <h3>She Got Game, The Documentary</h3>

                    <p>
                        Whether they’re rocking it out on their home consoles or portable gaming devices, designing the next hit RPG or competing in the Major League Gaming Championship, women are building a gaming world of their own. And yet their interests and achievements are still largely under-represented. We're interested in examining how gaming fits into women's lives socially and professionally. We also hope to learn about the particular challenges these women face and how they've built a community for themselves.


                    </p>

                    <p>We’ve got our protagonist. We’ve figured out how to jump, duck, and roll and we’ve defeated a boss or two. But now we need a 1UP…or a pair of rocket boots…or a mega blaster upgrade. She Got Game is a multi-player adventure, which means the more players involved, the better our chances at winning…with style. Your support and enthusiasm means access to more events, better equipment, and maybe even secret codes to bonus levels...
